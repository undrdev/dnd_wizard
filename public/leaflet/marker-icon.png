# This is a placeholder for the Leaflet marker icon
# In a real implementation, you would copy the actual PNG files from node_modules/leaflet/dist/images/
# to the public/leaflet/ directory

# Required files:
# - marker-icon.png
# - marker-icon-2x.png  
# - marker-shadow.png

# For now, create empty files or copy from leaflet package after npm install
